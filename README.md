Thank you for your interest in our Hotel Management System! To get started, follow these steps to download and run the project on your computer:

Step 1: Clone the Repository

Navigate to the GitHub repository containing the Hotel Management System project.
Click on the "Code" button and select "Download ZIP" to download the project files to your computer.
Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a location of your choice.
Step 2: Install Dependencies

Before running the project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

You can install these dependencies using pip, the Python package manager. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you extracted the project files, and run the following command:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
This command will install all the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.

Step 3: Set Up Virtual Environment

It's recommended to set up a virtual environment for running the project to isolate its dependencies from other Python projects on your system. To create and activate a virtual environment, run the following commands in your terminal:

Copy code
virtualenv venv
For Windows:

Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
For Unix/macOS:

bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Step 4: Run the Project

Once the dependencies are installed and the virtual environment is activated, you can run the project. Navigate to the directory containing the manage.py file and run the following command:

Copy code
python manage.py runserver
This command will start the Django development server, and you should see output indicating that the server is running. You can now access the Hotel Management System by opening a web browser and navigating to http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
